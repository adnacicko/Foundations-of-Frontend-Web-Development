For Project one, I decided to create a website for the restaurant page. The name of the restaurant, its content and logo is part of my imagination, and it does not exist. I found pictures of the interior, food from the menu on the Internet and combined them. I designed the logo and certain photos myself, using Canva. I made the page for the restaurant, in order to highlight the most important features, at least in my opinion, that one page of a certain restaurant should contain. First of all, for easy access to data, menu, contact and reservation.

The content of the page:

1. Home page: 
The home page represents the core of the site, as well as the main page. It enables access to various sections, materials that provide more different information about the restaurant.

2. Menu page: 
The menu page represents the restaurant's menu, it is divided into three sections and allows the user to see the selection of dishes that the restaurant offers. It is located in the navbar, and it is made in a special file.

3. About Us, Offers, Our Chefs, Reviews: 
Sections in the Home page, which present more information about the very topic of the website - restaurant. By clicking on them in the navbar - they are displayed.

4. Contact and Book Table buttons: 
By clicking on these buttons, a modal opens, more precisely a form that the user needs to fill out in two cases - if he wants to contact the restaurant (state his opinion, recommendations, reviews) and if he wants to reserve a place.

5. Header and footer: 
Of course, two main components, header and footer. The header gives access to the previously mentioned sections with one click, the footer gives more information about social networks, restaurant opening hours and contact information (Email, Phone number and Location).

I used simple colors that go together - red and yellow, avoiding a large range of colors for the sake of aesthetics. The page is dominated by photos, edited using features suitable for that (carousel, css, hover).
