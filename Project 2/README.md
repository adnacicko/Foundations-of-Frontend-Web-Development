For Project two, I decided to create a website for the restaurant page. The name of the restaurant, its content and logo is part of my imagination, and it does not exist. I found pictures of the interior, food from the menu on the Internet and combined them. I designed the logo and certain photos myself, using Canva. I made the page for the restaurant, in order to highlight the most important features, at least in my opinion, that one page of a certain restaurant should contain. First of all, for easy access to data, login page, contact and reservation.

The content of the page:

1. File arrangement: The files are arranged in folders according to their extensions. We have html, js, css, folders for photos and similar. The code looks much more organized.

2. Interactive Gallery: An interactive gallery has been implemented, so that when the user clicks on the photo, he will have the opportunity to see it in an enlarged format, with a short description of it.

3. Content Toggle: I implemented this section in the sense that I added a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and a read more button for more details, i.e. the continuation of the text.

4. Theme Switcher: User can change the theme of the page - from light to dark (white - black), with that the font color changes (red - yellow).


5. Accordion Menu: Created as a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). When you click on the question section, the answer is displayed, you can hide it again.

6. Advanced Form Validation: A form has been implemented - for restaurant reservations. The form cannot be submitted until all fields are filled with data. Valid data must be entered in fields such as - email, mobile number, selection, message, date and time.

7. Data - Driven Content - Using AJAX and JSON file, I implemented this item as events calendar. All events in the restaurant are displayed in the form of an event calendar. They can be seen on a monthly basis.

8. Form Submission with AJAX: When we submit the form with filled data, i.e. the reservation, we will see the data loading and then a success message is displayed, that we have successfully submitted the reservation. I used toastr for that.

9. Notifications: For any error or success message, I used toastr.

10. Single Page Application: Given that my page is in one index file, SPAPP is implemented so that when we click on a section, the page will take us to it.

11. View More: When we submit the form with the data, by clicking on the View More link, it prints the data saved on localstorage, that is, it prints the data entered in the form.

12. Edit and Delete: Implemented in the form of reviews. The user can add, edit and delete the review. Reviews are written from a JSON file.


Conclusion:

The purpose of the project was to present the handling of data on one page, adding simple details, in order to make it easier for the user to find everything he needs, quite simply.
